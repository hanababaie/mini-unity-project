"# mini-unity-project" 
This is my first experience in making a game with Unity. In this project, I have recreated the classic Space Invaders game using Unity's features and scripting.

Features
Classic Space Invaders gameplay where the player controls a spaceship to shoot and defeat invading aliens.

Simple animations for both the player's spaceship and enemies.

Scoring system to track player performance.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship left or right.

Press the spacebar/up arrow to shoot projectiles at the invading aliens.

Destroy all enemies to move on to the next level.

Keep an eye on your score and lives!

Basic understanding of Unity and C# scripting.

Installing
Clone or download the repository:

Click Play to start the game within the Unity editor.

Play the Game
Once the game is running, you can use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot.
